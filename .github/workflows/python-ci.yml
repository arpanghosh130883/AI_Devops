The issue is with the indentation of the "Lint with flake8" step. The `- name: Lint with flake8` line is indented more than it should be. Here is the corrected YAML:

```yaml
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest

    - name: Mock Deployment
      run: |
        echo "Deploying application..."
```

In YAML, indentation is very important and must be consistent. The `- name: Lint with flake8` line should be at the same level as the other `- name:` lines, since they are all steps in the same job.
